DFIO is used to read and write data frames from string, streams or disk.  When building a library like this, one question that needs to be answered is "where do you draw the line on formats?".  For example, should DFIO read/write JSON?  The answer to that question is 'no', and the reason is that there are many JSON formats -- they are applicaton specific.  Application specific format should be read in an application specific package, and this is the case, for example, with Vega.  Formats like CSV, HD5 or Feather are application agnostic and should be included in DFIO.
